# CalculusProj
First ever side project. 

I found an old project of mine which was done back in high school.  
Our only computer science teach back then forced us to learn Pascal (my first programming language). After I learned that life didnt have to be this way, I took some time to learn about c++ and decided to work on this project.  
It was an attempt to create a calculus calculator that was capable of taking any function and performing an integral or derivative and displaying the output using latex.  
At the time wolfram alpha had an input limit, so I challenged myself to create a limitless input parser which was capable splitting any large input into small chunks and performing the integral or derivative.
